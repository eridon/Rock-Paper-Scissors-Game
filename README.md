# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The player chooses either rock (1), paper (2), or scissors (3), and the program randomly chooses one of the three options for the computer. The program then determines the winner based on the standard rock-paper-scissors rules and displays the result. The player has the option to play again.
